##Overview and Origin
* Name of company: 
 
Venmo, LLC ("Venmo") is a US based peer-to-peer payment service alike a digital wallet service. Venmo is presently owned by PayPal.
 
*When was the company incorporated? 
 
Founded in 2009.
 
* Who are the founders of the company? 
 
Andrew Kortina and Iqram Magdon-Ismail.
 
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

They attempted to launch a music startup called that would allow users to purchase music by sending a text message to a band, and then have an mp3 file sent to their email. The detailed wireframes they created inspired the original electronic fund transfer service. The founders saw a need to improve fund transfer since checks and cash allowed for human errors, miscalculations, delays in bank transfer etc. PayPal existed but to young people barely use it. They wanted to become so commonplace they were a verb and 11 years later they are Venmo is a verb in every millennial's dictionary.
 
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? In May 2010, Venmo raised $1.2 million in seed money led by RRE Ventures and a group of other investors. Venmo was then acquired by Braintree for $26.6 million in 2012. The following year PayPal acquire Braintree for $800 million and Venmo was brought into the PayPal family. Venmo now exists as a subsidiary of PayPal.
 
## Business Activities:
* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
 
Andrew and Iqram given that they are friends and roommates had a problem that many people at the time faced - keeping track of their budgets and repaying each other for utilities like rent, electricity, groceries, movies etc. PayPal existed but they did not have a user-friendly mobile platform and it was established as a way to pay vendors so no one at the time used it to pay each other. Venmo bridged this gap in the market. They provided users with a simple mobile app platform and linked their app with a bank account and cell phone number. Once the initial set up was done, transferring money was quick, instantaneous and free. They found a problem in society and provided a simple solution packaged in a user-friendly app and made it a multi-million-dollar business.
 
* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

In the second quarter of 2020, Venmo’s net payment volume amounted to 37 billion U.S. dollars, representing a 52 percent year-on-year growth (Clement, 2020) . The company had more than 40 million active accounts at the end of the first quarter of 2019. Millennials quickly adopted the app and its growing consumer encouraged more members to get on it. The app has the option to have transactions appear publicly, similar to social media platforms that millennials use daily. The name was easy to make a verb and usage has been growing exponentially with college goers and youth professionals. Venmo unlike it’s rival did not charge a transaction, even though alike their competitor apps and parent, Venmo choses to absorb the transaction fees and this has allowed it to corner the millennial market.
 
As Venmo grew and PayPal acquired the company, Venmo made strategic partnerships with popular apps such as Uber, UberEATS, Grubhub, Chipotle etc. which allowed them to accelerate their growth. The volume of payments and transactions grew as did the consumer base. Venmo has the funding, the marketing and effective market positioning that many of their peers did not and they were able to become a universal method of payment, sometimes preferred over cash. 
 
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Venmo uses Plaid’s protocol known as application programming interface, or API. Plaid is a technology platform that enables applications to connect with user’s bank accounts. The company evolved out of the founders’ discovery that connecting bank accounts for fintech was a very painful process, so they sought to build a unified banking API that would solve this for other applications (JS, 2019).

## Landscape:
* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Venmo operates in the peer-to-peer payments and banking domain.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? 

Over the last decade, the industry has been booming and developing technologically exponentially. Consumers have found incredible value in the convenience that mobile-banking and money transfers have provided and Venmo was able to capitalize on this when there was a gap in the market. Digital wallets and payment apps have through strategic partnerships with retailers are eradicating the need to use cash and debit cards. As a personal example, I few months ago I lost my debit card and I generally avoid using my one US credit card. I intended on using cash for the 10 days it would take the card to get to me. I ended up using cash one time on day 1 to pay for gum at a 7/11, I used Venmo to pay for my Ubers to work, Grubhub for meals and direct transfers to my friends for dinners or entertainment. I realized I did not really need much other than Venmo to make payments.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

PayPal, CashApp, Zelle, Stripe, Mozido. 

## Results
* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Venmo has been extremely successful it it’s endeavors thus far and continues to grow its transaction volume and consumer base. 
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Venmo’s parent company PayPal uses transaction volume to report Venmo’s growth. Venmo processed $21 billion in total payment volume, a 73% increase from a year ago. Additionally, Venmo monitors new active accounts. The company reported important growth metrics during the quarter, including 9.3 million net new active accounts, compared with 8.1 million net new actives in the year-ago quarter, representing a 15 percent increase from the prior-year period (Jones, 2019.)

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

CashApp is closing in on Venmo but Venmo via the aforementioned partnerships and its existing consumer base is largest peer-to-peer payment application and digital wallet in the US (Freidrich, 2020).

## Recommendations
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

They’ve really done it all. Short of being a bank, I can use Venmo for anything I want to purchase. My biggest regret when I saw girl scouts was that I had no cash but the most dire need for Thinmints. Venmo has even fixed that. I can now buy as many Thinmints that my heart desires and very quickly send $50 (that I probably should not have spent) to this girl scouts mom. Venmo really has changed payments and money transfers as we know it. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

More strategic partnerships will help them grow even more. The more store customers that use Venmo to pay, the more Venmo is able to grow.

Additionally, setting up an autopay type feature would also be helpful given the primary intention of this app was to pay roommates for periodic utilities etc.
